# Elixir

This is an implementation in the [Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## Running

To run you will need Elixir installed. Get the latest version [from here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for your system.

This collatz program is just implemented as an elixir script

``` shell
elixir ./collatz.zig
```

You can pass in an input number directly as an argument instead of being prompted for it. E.g. to run for the value 42:

``` shell
elixir ./collatz.zig 42
```
